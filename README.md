## Use

Example:

```
./harvest.sh datacite
```

This will run a harvest with `datacite.xml` as the harvester configuration. The output will appear in the `output/datacite` directory.

## Configuration

Copy the file `harvest-config.inc.default.sh` to  `harvest-config.inc.sh` and adapt any of the settings in that file. It is automatically sourced by the harvest script.
